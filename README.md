 The only button on the first image with implementation is the Attendee button. Pressing this leads to the second image, which is the profile creation screen. Erquette informed us that the first time an attendee runs the app, they should be prompted to create an account. Filling the fields in on the second image and confirming uploads the data to Firebase. The UI here is really primitive, I spend little time on them, i am only currently focusing on trying to get activites and the logic implemented. 

Note: Last lab session Erquette informed us that all users must be able to attend events. So administrators and organizers must be able to attend events. The way we should think about it is that organizers and administrators are just special attendees, so everyone needs to be an attendee. So based on this, after a user selects their role this profile creation page should appear to everyone, considering they need to be able to attend events. So for first app runtime i imagine these will be the first two screens a user will see
